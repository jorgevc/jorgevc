My work focusses on the dynamics of infectious diseases, in particular, vector-borne diseases as Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya. I propose prevention and control strategies in situations where spatial factors and mobility play a role. I also study the effects of spatial structure in the coexistence of species. I use mathematical models in combination with computational simulations. I look to make my research multidisciplinary by collaborating with biologist, physicist and mathematicians.
